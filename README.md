# Pebble ToDo

Perhaps a bit of a misnomer. The purpose of this project is two-fold:

# Develop a Pebble app that makes it easy to set a reminders from your Pebble.
# Give me an opportunity to learn the Pebble dev tools.

## Desired app behavior

"ToDo" is actually a bit of a misnomer for the desired end behavior. I want a user, when they think of something they need to do later, to set a mini-reminder on their Pebble watch. The reminders will contain very little actual information, maybe a name, perhaps just an icon (no description text, no due date, etc). The reminder is intended to act as a virtual "string around your finger" so that you remember there's something to do. It's not intended to help you remember any specific details about that task.

## Implementation plan

Since I'm new to Pebble app development, I'm going to start with what's most simple & familiar (Pebble.js with built-in UI components) but I hope that eventually I'll be able to more thoroughly customize/optimize the UI and perhaps even switch to Pebble C for better performance & battery life.
